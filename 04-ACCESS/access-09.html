<!-- HTML5's audio element gives semantic meaning when it wraps sound or audio stream content in your markup. Audio content also needs a text alternative to be accessible to people who are deaf or hard of hearing. This can be done with nearby text on the page or a link to a transcript.

The audio tag supports the controls attribute. This shows the browser default play, pause, and other controls, and supports keyboard functionality. This is a boolean attribute, meaning it doesn't need a value, its presence on the tag turns the setting on.

Here's an example:

<audio id="meowClip" controls>
  <source src="audio/meow.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" />
  <source src="audio/meow.ogg" type="audio/ogg" />
</audio>
Note: Multimedia content usually has both visual and auditory components. It needs synchronized captions and a transcript so users with visual and/or auditory impairments can access it. Generally, a web developer is not responsible for creating the captions or transcript, but needs to know to include them.

Time to take a break from Camper Cat and meet fellow camper Zersiax (@zersiax), a champion of accessibility and a screen reader user. To hear a clip of his screen reader in action, add an audio element after the p. Include the controls attribute. Then place a source tag inside the audio tags with the src attribute set to "https://s3.amazonaws.com/freecodecamp/screen-reader.mp3" and type attribute set to "audio/mpeg".

Note: The audio clip may sound fast and be difficult to understand, but that is a normal speed for screen reader users. -->
